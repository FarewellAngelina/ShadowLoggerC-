DISCLAIMER:

This is the c++ version of the c# original keylogger that's on this github for educational purposes.
This was left basically as a "test" project since i never did anything else in c++ for real.

The source code is well commented and almost all of the features are present, except sending any email with the log, or any remote command, basically just local.
In my opinion this version is somewhat better than the original although it's not finished, i spent many hours optimizing the code individually, all of the three hooks works perfectly.

FEATURES:

Keyboard logging (PT)
Clipboard logging
Window changed logging
Computer info to populate the log.
No window (completely stealth)
Memory footpring around 1MB in x86. (didn't test x64)

CONCLUSION:

If you read the code, you'll see this is basically in "Debug mode" , as the original is (although ready to be compiled and used) , that doesn't mean it's not ready for production, it just means i didn't test it further in an actual environment, but there shouldn't be any kind of problems since i did test it and optimized it over several months.
